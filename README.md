# **Customer Feedback Analysis Dashboard**

## **1. Executive Summary:**
This project aims to design a meaningful, data-rich, and insightful dashboard using Tableau to understand and manage customer satisfaction, feedback volume, and sentiment trends across various business categories.  
The visual dashboard will focus on key customer experience metrics such as Average Feedback Score, Promoter Count, and Sentiment Analysis. The goal is to empower stakeholders (e.g., Customer Service, Product Managers) with data-backed insights to proactively improve service quality, product offerings, and overall customer experience—ultimately contributing to informed decision-making and customer retention.
